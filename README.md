# cal2homebank
Retrieve expense from ical and convert to homebank 

This is a Python script that read expenses from an ical file and 
converts to a csv ready to be imported in the homebank application

Why
---

- Homebank is cool but does not have an android app
- I need something to track expenses while I'm alone from my PC
- I don't like to program android|ios|windowsphone|whatever apps
- I want to use the calendar to log the expense
